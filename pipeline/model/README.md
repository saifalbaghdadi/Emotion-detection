# Emotion detection

## Mission objectives

- Be able to analyze and classify images of faces according to the facial-expression.
- Be able to analyze real-time images (video streaming) and implement facial-expression recognition.
- Explore techniques to identify emotions from subtle movements or gestures on the face.

## The Mission

An important global firm receives thousands of job applications every year. However, the HR team does not have
enough time to review each one of the applications. This is the reason why they are looking for innovative solutions
to be integrated into the selection and recruitment process.

Looking to accelerate the interview pace, the company is investing resources in a video-interview system where pre-defined questions are asked by a virtual HR agent. In some jobs, personality is an important asset and the company would like to automatically analyze the images from the video footage, quantify the emotions expressed by the job applicants, and select the appropriate candidate according to the open job opportunities. They want to take it a step further, detecting a smile or sad face is not enough. They want a tool capable of recognizing even subtle changes in facial expression that might
indicate a particular emotion.
